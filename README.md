A small project intended to solve an interview puzzle.

_Summary:_ Hold volunteer data and match them with voters
_Client:_ Karen - running for office in Michigan
_Request:_ I need volunteers to give me their first name, last name, middle initial, and date of birth. I also need to know what their political interests are. I also need to match these people with the voter data that I have about voters in my district. The format of the voter data will be name, age, location, phone number, and date last contacted.

_Requirements I have set:_
* A form for volunteers to sign up.
* An app that matches volunteers with voters
* In the future: a system that prioritizes which voters to reach out to.
